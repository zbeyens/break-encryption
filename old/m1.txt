Hello Bob! Alice here. Last meeting was a sound success, but there are still important points to discuss before launching phase two of the project.
You need to contact Charlie about the password, just tell him that I sent you and he will tell you what you need to.
Also do not forget that Dean's involvement in the project is supposed to be secret, so don't tell anyone please.
The safe's password is OPENSESAME. I know, not very inventive.
Best regards, Alice.
